# Fruit_Ninja_VR
 This project is a VR adaptation of the popular Fruit Ninja game, built using Unity for Oculus Quest 2.

In this VR game, the player slices fruits using a sword. The goal is to slice as many fruits as possible while avoiding bombs. The game tracks the player's score, the number of fruits sliced, and the lives remaining. With immersive VR controls, the player physically swings the sword to cut through the fruits as they appear, creating a dynamic and engaging experience.
